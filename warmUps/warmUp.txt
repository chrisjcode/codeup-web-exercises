Dream Job

My ideal job would be a job that's hybrid onsite and remote. I would like to be able to choose the days that I am remote. I would like to in the financial industry, airline, or health care industry. I have a few years experience so I want a salary of at least high $90s, but preferably 100k annually. The type of work Id prefer is new feature development. I don't really prefer code maintenance to be the majority of the work. I like smaller teams because you can get to know everyone and its not a lot of people that you have to coordinate with to produce deliverables. I have had my eye on American Airlines. I prefer a job working with technology Angular.

SMART Goals

Time-Bound

I want a software engineering job using current versions of Angular and Java or Angular and Node.js developing new features. I would like to be in the financial, health care or airline sector. I would like to start working by June 1st. I will be interviewing for jobs for my entire enrollment at Codeup to keep my interview practice up. The CodeUp class should give me an edge against other candidates. I can do this!
